# Computation of the n-th digit of π with low memory

These Racket modules implement an algorithm to compute *single decimals* of the
sequence of π digits, using only a small amount of memory.

This work is based on [Fabrice Bellard's paper](http://bellard.org/pi/pi_n2/pi_n2.html)
and his published code can be found under the `examples` folder, in `pi.c`.
